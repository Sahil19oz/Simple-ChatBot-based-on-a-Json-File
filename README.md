# Simple-ChatBot-based-on-a-Json-File
here we are given some json files where rules and expected inputs are defined with conditions and choices,the python script deals 
with all the conditions and choices and follows the json file accordingly and runs on a python shell but this code can be coorporated 
in a GUI and can be executed succesfully.
For any help or Query you can mail me @ 198sahilagarwal@gmail.com
